/*
  Warnings:

  - The `role` column on the `invitation` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - Changed the type of `role` on the `member` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
